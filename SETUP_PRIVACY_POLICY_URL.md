## üéØ For Chrome Web Store Submission

Once you have your URL, use it in the Chrome Web Store form:

**Privacy Policy URL field:**
```
https://allrounder687.github.io/streaming-extended/privacy-policy.html
```
(or whichever URL you chose)

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before submitting to Chrome Web Store:

- [ ] Privacy policy URL is publicly accessible
- [ ] URL loads correctly in incognito/private browsing
- [ ] Content matches your extension's actual data practices
- [ ] Last updated date is current
- [ ] Contact information is accurate
- [ ] URL is permanent (won't change)

## üîÑ Future Updates

When you need to update your privacy policy:

**GitHub Pages**: Just update the file in your repository
**GitHub Gist**: Edit the gist directly
**Netlify**: Re-upload the updated file

The URL stays the same, so you won't need to update the Chrome Web Store listing.
