# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

Your Streaming Extended project is now ready to be uploaded to GitHub! Follow these steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - **Repository name**: `streaming-extended` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Multi-platform Chrome extension for auto-skipping intros, credits, and recaps on Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and Max`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

5. **Click "Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your project directory:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/streaming-extended.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload

After pushing, your repository should contain:
- âœ… All source code files
- âœ… Documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- âœ… License file
- âœ… Backup system scripts
- âœ… Extension files (manifest.json, content.js, etc.)
- âœ… Build configuration (package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)

## ðŸ“‹ Repository Configuration

### Repository Settings
Once uploaded, configure these settings in your GitHub repository:

#### General Settings
- **Features**: Enable Issues, Discussions, Wiki
- **Pull Requests**: Enable "Allow merge commits" and "Allow squash merging"
- **Branches**: Set main as default branch

#### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - âœ… Require pull request reviews before merging
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging

#### Topics/Tags
Add these topics to help others discover your repository:
- `chrome-extension`
- `streaming`
- `netflix`
- `hotstar`
- `prime-video`
- `disney-plus`
- `auto-skip`
- `javascript`
- `typescript`
- `manifest-v3`

### Issue Templates
GitHub will automatically detect your CONTRIBUTING.md file. You can also create issue templates:

1. Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
2. Add templates for bug reports and feature requests

### GitHub Actions (Optional)
Consider setting up automated workflows:
- **Build verification** on pull requests
- **Extension packaging** on releases
- **Code quality checks** with ESLint

## ðŸ“¦ Creating Releases

### Future Releases
