## Overview

Streaming Extended ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome browser extension collects, uses, and protects information when you use our service.

## Information We Collect

- **Skip Button Elements**: Detected on streaming pages to enable auto-skip functionality
- **Video Timing Information**: Current playback time and duration to determine optimal skip timing
- **User Preferences**: Your extension settings (skip delays, enabled features) stored locally in your browser

### Session Statistics
We track basic usage statistics locally on your device:
- Number of intros, credits, and recaps skipped
